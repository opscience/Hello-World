# Hello-World
Hi all, I going to attempt to model a series of reactions in hopes to make endless of products from pennies.
Hi, my name is Mr. Ramirez and I'm a high school Chemistry Teacher that wishes to first model and create a "Materilizer". Using nothing, but a pneey and the air around design a machine that can truely materialize anything at the atomic scale with the provide energy of Cu + NO2.
First I need to model the reaction CuCl + AlO3 --> Cu (s) + AlCl3 For Cu solid reacts exothermically with Nitric acid which is produced by a byproduct of conducting combustion reactions in the atmosphere (air = 75% N2).
Next I need to model the polyimerization of strylene with AlO3 to ensure temperature gradients don't deviate past X K and above all research in to the phsyical chemistry of gaseous aromatic rings and it's synthesis.
THough listed last safety is the number one prodity by the use of computer modeling and a series of steps and conditions one day it will be possible to materialize an apple for a penny.
